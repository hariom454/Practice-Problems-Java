# Practice-Problems-Java
Trying to make a collection of working examples of data structure and algorithms in Java.

## Set up guide
* Before setting up repo locally make sure you java environment set locally. Also it will be good if you have some IDE setup although it will be fine to run programs from CLI as well.
* Clone the repo 
* cd into particular package from where you want to run the example, e.g. wants to run Linked list, cd to LinkedList package and run the Main class from here
